@title: Lab Session 7 Task 2: Make the Robot Arm Align Itself with Targets

"""

# =============================================================================
#
# Based on your experience in previous labs and with your mobile robots, you need 
# to write some of your own code to move the robot arm so that it lines up with a 
# particular target.  First, you can use blob detection, shape detection, edge detection, 
# or any other method you prefer to find the relative coordinates of the target within
# your image.  Then, convert the image coordinates into whatever coordinate system
# you are using for kinematics (which could also be image coordinates) and calculate
# the vector required to position your arm and end effector directly over top of this target.
#
# It is easiest to move the arm in a horizontal plane with the camera and gripper 
# pointing straight down so that you only need to get the arm to put the target in 
# the centre of the camera view (assuming your camera is geometrically in the centre
# of your gripper between the fingers).  Try to get your arm to position itself as
# accurately and repeatably as possible using your inverse kinematics developed 
# in the previous labs.  Ideally, your arm should be able to move itself to follow
# the object in real time if you move the target object while the camera is 
# tracking it - this is a very impressive demonstration of visual servoing control.
# 
# =============================================================================
